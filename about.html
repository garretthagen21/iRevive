<p><font color="white">You go to pull your phone out of your pocket and suddenly you realize theat you didn't quite
have the tight grip you thought you did. You watch in helplessness as your $700 dollar device spirals through the air
on the sidewalk and lands with a devastating thud. With your heart in your stomach you reach down and flip your beloved iPhone
over only to face the crushing reality that the screen looks like a spider web. Sound familiar? <p>Breaking your phone is extremely
