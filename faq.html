       <td colspan=2 align="center"><font color="white">Once a customer has a repair done through iRevive, they immedietely become eligible <br>
         to make money just by referring their friends. <p>For example, when a previous customer refers a friend, the friend would write the name and Venmo tag of the customer that referred them
         in the designated box on the order form. As soon the new customer has their repair done, <font color="cyan">THE PERSON THAT REFERRED THEM WILL RECIEVE 10% OF THE SALE!</font>
         <p>There is no limit to
         how many people a previous customer can refer and can make approximately $50 just by spreading the word to 5 friends!
